Given that we know the Spread over time and other information, we want to find out purchaes price of the bond at current date.
To do so, we need to use the Bond Pricing function but this time, we 
set Porig as unknow and use fsolve to solve it.

df_data['CurrentPrice'] = df_data.apply( lambda row: fsolve(lambda x: 
  CF_equation(Porgi= x ,s = row['SpreadPeriod'],
  rf = bond_list(m= row['CouponsRemaining'],
  pdate= current_date, paymentperiod=row['Count']),FV = row['FaceValue'],
  c= row['CouponRate'],M=row['CouponsRemaining']), 
  x0=15000,xtol = 1.49012e-10),
  axis=1)
